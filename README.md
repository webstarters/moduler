A WordPress-plugin to create reusable components for use when page-building.

## Trouleshooting

### Why is Page Builder disabled on the custom post type?

By default, the page builder is only available on pages.

Go to WPBakery Page Builder Settings > Role Manager and change `Post types` to `Custom` and make sure `webstarters_module` is checked.
